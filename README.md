My wife asked me if i could somehow make an item that dispensed a marble one at a time for an activity they were planning. 
The Marble dispenser is a small box that uses an ESP32, a keypad and a servo arm to dispense a marble whenever the correct code as been input.
When the correct code has been entered (several hardcoded example codes are used for now), the servo arm will start moving until a piezo element at the bottom has detected an impact.
